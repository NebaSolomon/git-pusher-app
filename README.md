# git-pusher-app
i have created a lightweight desktop GUI (for my productivity, actually :) ) that lets you drag and drop any project folder, enter a version, repo URL, and branch â€” then instantly push it to GitHub or any remote repo. Built with Python and Git integration for quick, one-click version pushes and tagging.
